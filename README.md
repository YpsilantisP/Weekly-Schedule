# Weekly-Schedule (Demo)
This application can be used as an organiser of a weekly schedule.<p>
It uses as input: names of users (csv) and the number of people required per day.<p>
Outputs a weekly plan of the people assigned on each day of the week -- using a linear optimization<p>
Please note that the optimisation file is missing, hence the app will not be able to output the final table.
However, I can share my screen during the interview process
